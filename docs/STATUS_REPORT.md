## Issues Found

### Critical
None

### Warnings
1. **podcast-meditations**: 365 audio files committed before LFS setup - files are in regular git, not LFS
2. **podcast-therapist-gpt**: Remote repository doesn't exist on GitHub - local-only repository
3. **podcast-meditations**: Uncommitted changes (.wrangler/, transform_episodes.py, modified EXECUTION_PLAN.md and audio file)
4. **podcast-casting-software-spells**: Uncommitted "in progress/" folder

### Recommendations
1. For podcast-meditations: Consider re-committing audio files via LFS or document that these are legacy pre-LFS commits
2. For podcast-therapist-gpt: Create GitHub repository when ready to publish
3. Clean up uncommitted changes in podcast-meditations and podcast-casting-software-spells
